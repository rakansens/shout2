# App Flow Document for TON & LINE Mini App Game

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a new user discovers the mini app, they arrive at a landing page that clearly identifies the platform they are using, either TON (Telegram) or LINE. The landing page immediately gives users an option to proceed with authentication through the respective channels. For Telegram users, this involves logging in with Telegram OAuth integrated with Supabase Auth and JWT. For LINE users, the process uses LINE Login, again supplemented with Supabase Auth and JWT. From the landing page, users can either sign up or sign in. New users are prompted to create an account by providing the necessary credentials and completing the platform-specific process, which includes an optional wallet connection for LINE users and a recommended wallet connection for TON users. In case a user forgets their password, a simple recovery link is provided that guides the user through secure verification steps to reset their password. Once authenticated, users are directed to the main dashboard of the app and a clear log-out option is always available in the navigation section so that users can safely exit the platform.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After sign-in or sign-up, the user lands on the main dashboard which is designed to serve as the central hub for all app activities. This home screen showcases a dynamic quest list with daily login bonuses and other gamified elements. The interface is built to be intuitive, highlighting a structured navigation menu that sits across the top or side of the page. The major sections accessible from this page include the home area with quests and daily rewards, a ranking section that displays user statistics, a play section for launching the embedded game, a store where points can be exchanged for in-game items, and a settings area for managing profile information and preferences. The layout is consistent for users on both TON and LINE platforms while ensuring that specific actions like joining a Telegram channel or adding a LINE official account are prominently displayed in the appropriate contexts.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

From the home screen, users engage with several core features that form the heart of the game. In the quest area, users see a list of available quests with clear instructions and progress trackers. For Telegram users, there is an additional prompt to join a dedicated Telegram group to enhance their rewards, whereas LINE users are guided to add the official LINE account through context-sensitive cues. The home page also includes options for social network actions such as following a Twitter account or retweeting promotional content, ensuring that users stay engaged with interconnected digital profiles. When moving to the ranking section, users view their standings based on cumulative quest points, wallet addresses, and platform-specific usernames. Selecting the play option brings users to a musical track selection screen that serves as an introduction before launching the Unity WebGL game, ensuring smooth performance and responsiveness for mobile devices. The game itself is embedded directly within the mini app interface using optimized full-screen views that work well within the browsers of both TON and LINE WebViews. In the store feature, users spend the points they have earned to purchase items that can enhance quest rewards, game scores, or provide additional daily bonuses. Each store transaction is updated in real time, and the interface informs the user of their current points balance immediately after a purchase. The flow between these pages is seamless with clear navigation controls and back buttons that allow users to move between quests, gameplay, store transactions, and ranking displays with minimal interruption. Additionally, administrators have access to a dedicated management panel accessible via the common /admin URL where they can switch between TON and LINE data sets using a simple tab-based interface. The admin panel features comprehensive controls over quests, rankings, store items, user profiles, and detailed data analytics. This unified dashboard makes it easy for managers to oversee all aspects of the game, regardless of which platform the user is on.

## Settings and Account Management

Within the settings area, users are provided with a streamlined interface to manage their personal information and preferences. Here, users can update notification settings, configure account linkages, and manage wallet connections. The display adapts depending on the platform: for example, TON users will see wallet connection details highlighted, while LINE users will only see these options when necessary for specific quests. The settings page is accessible from the main navigation menu and includes options for language selection, profile updates, and security settings such as password changes. After making any changes, users can easily save their preferences and return directly to the main dashboard, ensuring that the settings adjustment process keeps the user firmly within the overall app flow.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

Any time a user enters invalid data, such as an incorrect password or fails to complete a required field during sign-up, the app displays a clear and friendly error message explaining what went wrong. In the event of connectivity issues, the app shows a fallback page that lets users know a network problem has occurred, with instructions on how they can try again once connectivity is restored. If a user attempts an action that is restricted—such as accessing premium content without the proper account status—the app courteously redirects them to an information or upgrade page. These error states are designed to be informative yet unobtrusive, ensuring that they support a quick recovery and guide the user back into the normal operational flow of the app without confusion.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

The overall journey in this app is designed to be intuitive and engaging from beginning to end. A new user first encounters a carefully guided onboarding experience with platform-specific authentication, seamlessly leading into a dynamic main dashboard where quests, daily login rewards, and gamified interactions drive engagement. The user can smoothly transition from engaging with quests to checking rankings, launching the game, and purchasing reward-enhancing items in the store. Settings and account management are easily accessible for keeping user preferences up to date. Administrators, on the other hand, have a dedicated management interface that allows for effective oversight of the entire system through a simple tab-based system. From sign-up to everyday use, the app maintains a consistent and connected flow, ensuring that users always know where they are and how to move forward, no matter which platform they choose to use.
